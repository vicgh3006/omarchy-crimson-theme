# Crimson: Sunset-themed minimalist theme for Omarchy.

A sleek and minimal theme that brings bold crimson accents to your desktop environment. Crimson's aesthetic is inspired by minimalist, pixelated illustrations of lakeside sunsets and dusk scenes, creating a warm and calming workspace with striking red highlights. Built specifically for Omarchy, this theme provides consistent styling across your window manager, terminal, applications, and system components.

**Status:** New updates coming soon.
